# IP Indicator Gnome Extension

## Overview

The **IP Indicator** Gnome extension provides a quick and easy way to display and interact with the IP addresses of your current network interfaces directly from the Gnome Shell. The extension shows your IP addresses in the top panel and allows copying them to the clipboard with a single click.

---

## Features

- **Display IP addresses:** View the IP addresses of your active network interfaces in the Gnome Shell top bar.
- **Copy IP address:** Click on the extension to copy the displayed IP address to the clipboard.
- **Scroll through IP addresses:** Use the mouse scroll to cycle through multiple IP addresses.
- **Automatic updates:** The displayed IP address updates every second to reflect changes in your network configuration.
- **Prioritized display:** The extension prioritizes private IP ranges (e.g., `10.x.x.x`, `192.x.x.x`, `172.x.x.x`) for display.
- **Public IP** shows the public facing IP using the DNS query. You can enable/disable public IP from extension settings and also set it's priority.
- For change log refer to [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

- May not display IP addresses correctly if the `ip` command output format changes. This is very unlikely to happen as entire networking depends on this command.
